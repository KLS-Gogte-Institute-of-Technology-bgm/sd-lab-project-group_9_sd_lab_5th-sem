# STUDENT ATTENDANCE BY BARCODE SCANNER
The proposed project is a system that keeps a track of students’ attendance using barcode scanner. This concept set forth to automate the traditional attendance system by using authentication technique. The traditional system requires a register maintained for manually signing the attendance by the students which is time consuming. Hence this proposed project eliminates the need of maintaining attendance sheet.
<br>
The proposed system uses barcode method for authenticating students with a unique barcode that represents their unique id. Every student will have their identity card. They have to scan their ids using barcode scanner and the system notes down their attendance as per date and time. System stores student’s attendance details and generates brief report for admin as required.
